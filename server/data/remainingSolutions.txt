SOLUTIONS TO ADD TO sampleChallenges.js

Due to file size, I'll create comprehensive solutions here and then integrate them into the main file.

==== Challenge 4: Real-time Data Processing Pipeline ====

This needs solutions for:
- Streaming data ingestion
- Real-time processing
- Data storage (raw + processed)
- Analytics capability

Solution 1: AWS Kinesis + Lambda + S3 + DynamoDB
- Kinesis Data Streams for ingestion
- Lambda for processing
- S3 for raw data lake
- DynamoDB for queryable processed data
- Cost: ~$120/month

Solution 2: AWS SQS + Lambda + S3 + Athena
- SQS for message queue
- Lambda for processing
- S3 for both raw and processed
- Athena for SQL analytics
- Cost: ~$95/month

==== Challenge 5: Multi-Region Disaster Recovery ====

Solution 1: Route53 + Multi-Region ELB + Aurora Global
- Route53 with health checks and failover
- ELB in two regions
- Aurora Global Database for cross-region replication
- EC2 in both regions
- Cost: ~$425/month

==== Challenge 6: AI Chatbot Deployment ====

Solution 1: API Gateway + Lambda + Llama 2 7B + DynamoDB
- API Gateway for REST endpoints
- Lambda for orchestration
- Llama 2 7B (cost-effective LLM)
- DynamoDB for conversation history
- Cost: ~$75/month

Solution 2: Lambda + RunPod LLaMA 70B + ElastiCache
- For higher quality responses
- Uses RunPod GPU inference
- ElastiCache for conversation caching
- Cost: ~$145/month

==== Challenge 7: Add Search to E-commerce ====

Solution 1: OpenSearch + Lambda
- OpenSearch cluster for full-text search
- Lambda to sync DynamoDB to OpenSearch
- DynamoDB Streams trigger for real-time updates
- Cost: ~$55/month

Solution 2: Algolia (managed search service)
- External managed service
- Lambda for data sync
- Cost: ~$85/month

==== Challenge 8: Add Caching to Slow API ====

Solution 1: ElastiCache Redis
- Simply add Redis cache layer
- Lambda reads from cache first
- Cache aside pattern
- Cost: ~$25/month

Solution 2: DynamoDB DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)
- If using DynamoDB instead of RDS
- In-memory cache
- Cost: ~$35/month

==== Challenge 9: Video Platform Analytics ====

Solution 1: Kinesis + Lambda + DynamoDB + S3
- Kinesis for event streaming
- Lambda for processing
- DynamoDB for real-time queries
- S3 for cold storage
- Cost: ~$115/month

Solution 2: SQS + Lambda + Timestream + S3
- SQS for event buffering
- Lambda for processing
- Timestream for time-series data
- S3 for archival
- Cost: ~$145/month

==== Challenge 10: AI Image Recognition ====

Solution 1: Lambda + Rekognition
- S3 event trigger on upload
- Lambda processes with Rekognition
- Updates DynamoDB with tags
- Cost: ~$55/month

Solution 2: Lambda + Azure Computer Vision
- Cross-cloud solution
- Azure Computer Vision API
- More detailed object detection
- Cost: ~$68/month
