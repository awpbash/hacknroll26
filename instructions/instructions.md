The main home page should follow the colour scheme and structure of hompage.jpg

The main challenge page should look similar and colour scheme like challenge.jpg

The drag and drop boxes should look similar to demo_2.png and demo_archi.png where the boxes are images of the services

We also need a learn more page where u can learn more about each cloud provider's microservice

Also add non big3 cloud like runpod, mongodb with the different compute capacity options so that we can do challenges like deploy a chatbot and choose a suitable serveless archi and llm model
